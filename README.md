DevOps Assignment

1. Five DevOps Concepts

1. Continuous Integration (CI)** – Frequently testing and merging code to avoid conflicts.
2. Continuous Deployment (CD)** – Automatically deploying application updates without manual steps.
3. Version Control (Git)** – Tracking code changes and maintaining clean project history.
4. Containerization (Docker)** – Packaging applications into lightweight containers that run anywhere.
5. Automation** – Reducing manual work using tools for automatic builds, tests, and deployments.
